# Drowsiness-Monitor
Drowsiness detection system using OpenCV, Dlib, NumPy 

## About
* This project is built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python
as a backend language
* The project includes direct working with the 68 facial
landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib
library
* The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained
efficient detector which detects the points on the human
